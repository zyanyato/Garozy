# 05 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past four modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use a CSS framework (see suggestions).

* Include at least one modal instead of native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality. Look into the CSS framework's documentation for more information!

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Frameworks

One of the requirements for this project is to incorporate a CSS framework into your application.

> **hint** There are different ways to add these frameworks, but for the purposes of this front-end project, you'll need to use the **CDN option**.

Look into one of the following CSS frameworks and add it to your project:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

* [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/)

* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

* [Foundation](https://get.foundation/)

* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

> **note** There are a lot of CSS frameworks out there&mdash;this is just a list to get you started. Feel free to use one not included in this list!
